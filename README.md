# BadgerLoop Dashboard

## Introduction
We will be using an Angular based dashboard for competition weekend.

## Installation
+ Fork this repo
+ Navigate to `Material_Design_Angular_Template` directory in the main `Dashboard` repo.

Install dependencies:

    $ npm install

Install gem 'sass'

    $ gem install sass

Run development web-server:

    $ gulp serve

The `gulp serve` command will auto-reload the browser with the changes that you have made upon save.

## Running from here on out
+ You will only need to run the `gulp serve` in `/Dashboard/Material_Design_Angular_Template` and then start hacking!

## Troubleshooting
Slack any problems to `#software`.  More likely than none, other people are having your same issue.
