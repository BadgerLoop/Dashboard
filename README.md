s# BadgerLoop Dashboard

## Introduction
We will be using an Angular based dashboard for competition weekend.

## Installation
+ Navigate to `Competition_Dashboard` directory in the main `Dashboard` repo.
+ Enter `backend-angular` then `master`
  + You should now be in `/Dashboard/Competition_Dashboard/backend-angular/master`
+ Run `npm start` inside this directory
  + This will automatically install npm packages, bower dependencies and finally gulp, all with just one command.
  + Note: You might need to install npm and its dependencies.  Feel free to contact me if you have trouble installing them.
+ Now, in a new terminal go back to `/Dashboard/Competition_Dashboard/backend-angular/`.  You should see `index.html` in this directory
+ Run `npm install -g live-server`
  + You only need to run this once
+ Finally, run `live-server` and you can go ahead and start hacking.  Every time you save the browser will auto reload its self.

## Running from here on out
+ You will only need to run the `live-server` in `/Dashboard/Competition_Dashboard/backend-angular/` and then start hacking!

## Troubleshooting
Slack any problems to #software.  More likely than none, other people are having your same issue.
