# BadgerLoop Dashboard

## Introduction
We will be using an Angular based dashboard for competition weekend.

## Installation
+ Fork this repo
+ Navigate to `ngBLDash` directory in the main `Dashboard` repo.

Install dependencies:

    $ bower install
    $ npm install

Run Grunt:

    $ grunt

Run grun web-server:

    $ grunt serve

The `grunt serve` command will auto-reload the browser with the changes that you have made upon save.

## Running from here on out
+ You will only need to run the `grunt serve` in `/Dashboard/ngBLDash` and then start hacking!

## Troubleshooting
Slack any problems to `#software`.  More likely than none, other people are having your same issue.
